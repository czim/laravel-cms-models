# List Filter Strategy: Basic String

Simple string filter that searches for loosy, unsplit `%search term%` matches.

Shows a simple text input. The text entered will be searched for 1-to-1 in the targets.

The search is loosy, so if the full searched text appears anywhere in the targets, the record is a match.
